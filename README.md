# immunoblaster
This is a GBA game created for my CS2261 Final Project. It was inspired by interest in overlapping medicine/healthcare and technology. In this game you are a doctor who has to collect health boxes 
and beat enemy "viruses" by shooting pills or bubbles. Along the way you can also collect different powerups that will affect the 
behavior of your pill blaster. <br />
